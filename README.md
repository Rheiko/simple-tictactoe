# How to use
- By using the Command Line Interface, the program will display the current situation of the TicTacToe Board.
- Player will be asked to input x and y coordinate (Starts from 0) of the board to place their mark.
- The game will end when one of the two players gets a straight line of marks in the board or if there's no more option in the board to choose from
which will ultimately end the game as draw.

To avoid possible confusion, here is the coordinate for each option in the board:

- |(0,0)|(0,1)|(0,2)|
- |-----------------|
- |(1,0)|(1,1)|(1,2)|
- |-----------------|
- |(2,0)|(2,1)|(2,2)|
- |-----------------|
